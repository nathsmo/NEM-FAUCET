A NEM Faucet created for the Technologies and freedom class at UFM 2019. Turned in October of 2019. Feel free to download and try it but make sure to change the secret key and your password (from your NEM wallet of course).

## Requirements

For development, you will need:
* Node
* Express
* NEM-SDK
* Express-handlebars
* Path
* BodyParser
* MethodOverride
* Redis

You may install all the requirements through `npm install`. If you find an error then just install them manually.

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/nathsmo/NEM-FAUCET.git
    $ cd NEM-FAUCET
    $ npm install or yarn install

## Configure app

Open the `app.js` file then edit it with your settings. You will need to enter your password and your private key in two different places. The fields literally say "YOUR PRIVATE KEY HERE" or "YOUR PASSWORD HERE". Also remember if you want to send a personal message to the people receiving the XEM from the faucet you can change it with the variable `message`.

## Running the project

    $ npm start

## Happy Coding!
